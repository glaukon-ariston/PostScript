|C|3PROLOGUE
|0|FD|1arcie didn’t expect to live. With the hand she could
move enough to reach them, she tore unit and command
patches from her uniform shirt\261left only her nametag,
rank and flight surgeon’s insignia. She drew out the chain
from around her neck, yanked off the two crystal pendants
hanging with her ID tags, and shoved them into the corner
behind her.|p
"Mama?" The child stirred on her lap, trying to push
himself back. "Why are\261" She put a finger to his lips,
her other hand cupping his head to prevent its bump- ing
the metal bulkhead. "Hush, Tris."
She could barely whisper; she sat on the bottom of a locker
meant only for a pressure suit\261one of four in the
maintenance compartment\261with the toddler held snug
between her body and her drawn-up knees.
Outside ship noises reached her: the roar of engines
crescendoing toward thrust into lightskip\261the fourth
attempt. She braced her head well back in the corner behind
the pressure suit, hugged Tristan to her breast and locked
her teeth.
REST OF STORY GOES HERE . . .
She lunged left into the cross corridor, her right fist
punching the manual trigger on its bulkhead. The shield
door dropped behind her with a whoosh that was lost in a
crunch and her pursuer’s garbled scream. She pressed
Tristan’s face to her shoulder and forced herself not to look
back.
The cross passage opened on one parallel to the concourse
she had sealed. It led to the lifepods\261if they hadn’t
already been jettisoned.
She pressed herself to the bulkhead to listen for pursuers
and to peer into the concourse. It was empty, up and down,
except for the smoke-obscured shapes of bodies on the
deck. She tried to set the child on his feet, to rest her arm,
but he only clung to her, wide- eyed with the recognition of
her fear.
Darcie smoothed his hair and kissed his forehead. "Come
on then, little soldier," she said, collecting him again, and
slipped on into the passage. Smoke from screen grenades
stung her eyes, making them run and blurring her vision.
She stumbled over a body and paused, panting. One of the
surface troopers, a young man she didn’t know. Flung
beyond his hand lay an energy pistol.
